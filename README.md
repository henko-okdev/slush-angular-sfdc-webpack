This is the slush generator for AngularJS (ES6) Apps created in Webpack way and hosted on Salesforce.com


## Getting Started

Install `slush` and `slush-angular-sfdc-webpack` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush slush-angular-sfdc-webpack
```

### Usage

Navigate to your project folder and scaffold AngularJS apps structure

```bash
$ cd my-sfdc-project
$ slush angular-sfdc-webpack:package
```

While creating a package you can enter Salesforce credentials to your project or you need to provide it after package scaffolding. To do that, open `my-sfdc-project/package/config/jsforce.config.js` file and edit it with valid username, password and security token.

Then go to apps folder and create a new application, it will create a Visualforce page with corresponding StaticResource where the application files are stores

```bash
$ cd package/apps
$ slush angular-sfdc-webpack:app
```

>The task for a new application is default, you can run it in the next way -  `$ slush angular-sfdc-webpack`

The generator has different tasks:
- `package`: create a folders structure for AngularJS apps
- `app`: scaffold a new AngularJS application. Run this task from `apps` folder of the package
- `component`: create a folder structure for a component
- `service`: create a new service

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.
